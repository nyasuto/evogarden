# Contributor Guide

## Dev Environment Tips
- Use pnpm dlx turbo run where <project_name> to jump to a package instead of scanning with ls.
- Run pnpm install --filter <project_name> to add the package to your workspace so Vite, ESLint, and TypeScript can see it.
- Use pnpm create vite@latest <project_name> -- --template react-ts to spin up a new React + Vite package with TypeScript checks ready.
- Check the name field inside each package's package.json to confirm the right nameâ€”skip the top-level one.

## Testing Instructions
- Find the CI plan in the .github/workflows folder.
- run go test
